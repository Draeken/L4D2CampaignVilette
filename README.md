# L4D2CampaignVilette
> Assets for L4D2 Campaign Vilette

## Idea
A L4D2 campaign/versus map based on [Parc de la Vilette]() and [Cité des Sciences]()
The real park features a sinuous route going through interesting spots. It could be used to limit the natural openness of the park.
It includes a lot of small structure, bridge, and other height variation that makes things interesting.
Due to the wide map boundaries, it should be splited into 4 levels, with one level dedicated to the Cité des Sciences. Map scale should also be reduced to 70% (otherwise the first level will fill 90% of Hammer space in one direction).
Map structure could be reused for other source games.

## NB
I don't consider myself owner of this project. Only a simple contributor.
